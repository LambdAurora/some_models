# Pro W Spool Holder

The spool holder for the Pro W can be printed with the Pro W but it's really complicated, you have to tune your slicer correctly
and you have to put the model at 45째.

# Quick note about the first version

The first version of this spool holder was designed to be two parts which would be screwed/glued together but I highly don't recommend to print them as 
it's really not stable to be used.

# Printing

The spool holder must be printed 2 times to be useful, but be careful, the second one must be mirrored.

The spool holder can be printed with the Pro W but it will require tuning the slicer and to place it at ~45째 (42째 or 45째 seem ok) as it takes all the place on the bed.

The glass holder may have to be moved if you have a second fan on the extruder to cool down the print.

# Mount and placement

To mount it on your printer you have to unscrew the LCD/SD card reader/Control board on top.

The holder will be between the printer's structure and the board and will be screwed in. The printer's M3 screws should be ok.

Be careful when putting the spool as the parts may be a bit weak.

The little padded plastic should be heading "in" (the two little padded plastic should look at each other if the print was correctly mirrored).

# Final note

Don't hesitate to improve the design!

The goal though is to allow the piece to sill be printed on this printer, else it would be less useful.

Also, don't hesitate to make a pull request for an improved design!
